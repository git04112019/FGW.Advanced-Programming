# Template method

Real world example

> Suppose we are getting some house built. The steps for building might look like
> - Prepare the base of house
> - Build the walls
> - Add roof
> - Add other floors

> The order of these steps could never be changed i.e. you can't build the roof before building the walls etc but each of the steps could be modified for example walls can be made of wood or polyester or stone.

In plain words

> Template method defines the skeleton of how a certain algorithm could be performed, but defers the implementation of those steps to the children classes.
