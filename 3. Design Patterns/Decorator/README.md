# Decorator

Real world example

> Imagine you run a car service shop offering multiple services. Now how do you calculate the bill to be charged? You pick one service and dynamically keep adding to it the prices for the provided services till you get the final cost. Here each type of service is a decorator.

In plain words

> Decorator pattern lets you dynamically change the behavior of an object at run time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class.
