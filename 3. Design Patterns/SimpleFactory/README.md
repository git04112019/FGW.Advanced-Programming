# Simple Factory

Real world example

> Consider, you are building a house and you need doors. It would be a mess if every time you need a door, you put on your carpenter clothes and start making a door in your house. Instead you get it made from a factory.

In plain words

> Simple factory simply generates an instance for client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client.

When to use

 > When creating an object is not just a few assignments and involves some logic, it makes sense to put it in a dedicated factory instead of repeating the same code everywhere.
