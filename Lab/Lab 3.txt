– Dealer collects ante from appropriate players, shuffles the deck, and deals each player a hand of 2 cards from the deck.

– A betting round occurs, followed by dealing 3 shared cards from the deck.

– As shared cards are dealt, more betting rounds occur, where each player can fold, check, or raise.

– At the end of a round, if more than one player is remaining, players' hands are compared, and the best hand wins the pot of all chips bet so far.
